# Bricks Heist

The room is based on the bricks builder plugin of WordPress, vulnerable to a critical security flaw known as CVE-2024-25600. This vulnerability affects all versions up to, and including, 1.9.6 of the Bricks Builder plugin. It exploits the handling of user inputs resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).

We start by enumerating using nmap.

Nmap â†’  nmap -sC -sV 10.10.82.159

The scan reveals two web pages running on ports 80 and 443. Upon examining the second page, we discover a WordPress 6.5 installation with a wp-admin page that is disallowed through robots.txt.

Trying to brute force it using common credentials did not take us anywhere.

Further analysis of the webpage reveals that the target is using version 1.9.5 of the Bricks plugin.

`wpscan --url [https://bricks.thm/](https://bricks.thm/) --disable-tls-checks` 

Disabled TLS check to ensure the attack functions correctly.

Looking for an exploit online takes us to :

[`https://github.com/K3ysTr0K3R/CVE-2024-25600-EXPLOIT/blob/main/CVE-2024-25600.py](https://github.com/K3ysTr0K3R/CVE-2024-25600-EXPLOIT/blob/main/CVE-2024-25600.py)`

Using the exploit returns us a shell. Which is a good starting point.

Looking through the files we find a suspicious file that gave us the first flag.

While searching through running processes for suspicious activity, we stumble upon TRYHACK3M.

`systemctl | grep running`

Following up on it we find the process running: nm-inet-dialog 

![image.png](image%207.png)

Let's examine `inet.conf`, which might contain interesting log information.

This appears to be some kind of bitcoin miner. It contains an ID, which piques our curiosity.

We use cyberchef to try decipher it. This gives us two bitcoin wallet addresses.

bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa
bc1qyk79fcp9had5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa
```

A quick online search reveals information about the transactions, including one particularly large transaction of $352,898.

The wallet addresses provide additional information about the individual, which leads us to discover details about their associated organization.
